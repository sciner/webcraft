     * Should the `failIfMajorPerformanceCaveat` flag be enabled as a context option used in the `isWebGLSupported` function.
     * If set to true, a WebGL renderer can fail to be created if the browser thinks there could be performance issues when
     * using WebGL.
     *
     * In PixiJS v6 this has changed from true to false by default, to allow WebGL to work in as many scenarios as possible.
     * However, some users may have a poor experience, for example, if a user has a gpu or driver version blacklisted by the
     * browser.
     *
     * If your application requires high performance rendering, you may wish to set this to false.
     * We recommend one of two options if you decide to set this flag to false:
     *
     * 1: Use the `pixi.js-legacy` package, which includes a Canvas renderer as a fallback in case high performance WebGL is
     *    not supported.
     *
     * 2: Call `isWebGLSupported` (which if found in the PIXI.utils package) in your code before attempting to create a
     *    PixiJS renderer, and show an error message to the user if the function returns false, explaining that their
     *    device & browser combination does not support high performance WebGL.
     *    This is a much better strategy than trying to create a PixiJS renderer and finding it then fails.
