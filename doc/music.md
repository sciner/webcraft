# Music

Create folder `music` on the same level as `webcraft` and `resource-packs` folders.

Copy all the tracks into it. Only `.ogg` extension are supported.

Copy `music.json` file from the `webcraft/doc/examples` into `music`. Fill it with the names of the copied tracks (without the extensions).

To see the updated music in the game, run `npm run compile-assets` in `webcraft/node_server`.
